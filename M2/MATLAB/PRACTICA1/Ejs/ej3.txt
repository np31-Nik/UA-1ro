help roots
 <strong>roots</strong>  Find polynomial roots.
    <strong>roots</strong>(C) computes the roots of the polynomial whose coefficients
    are the elements of the vector C. If C has N+1 components,
    the polynomial is C(1)*X^N + ... + C(N)*X + C(N+1).
 
    Note:  Leading zeros in C are discarded first.  Then, leading relative
    zeros are removed as well.  That is, if division by the leading
    coefficient results in overflow, all coefficients up to the first
    coefficient where overflow occurred are also discarded.  This process is
    repeated until the leading coefficient is not a relative zero.
 
    Class support for input c: 
       float: double, single
